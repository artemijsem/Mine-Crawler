# Mine Crawler
This Real Time Strategy game was done for the purpose of researching A* pathfinding and how it can be implemented in games.
Additionally, I have attempted to implement AI behaviour for various enemies.
The goal of this game is to kill the final boss who is located behind the closed door of the dungeon.
To get to him you control 3 heroes that need to collect 3 keys that are scattered around the level.

# Run
In order to run the project in Debug configuration by using x64 Windows you would need to extract ```x64.zip``` into the root of the project as it contains assets and runtime DLLs that are necessary for the SDL 2 library to work.

# Controls
WASD - Move camera
LMB - Select units
RMB - Move units

# Notes
- Warrior hero is the only one who can regenerate health
- Goblins are feeble and will try to outnumber your group before attacking
- Skeletons will guard keys so there is no point in trying to lure them out one by one
- Demon boss will shoot projectiles
